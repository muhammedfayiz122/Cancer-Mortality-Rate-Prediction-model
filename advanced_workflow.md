### Linear Regression Project Workflow

#### 1 : Define the Problem Statement
1.1 Identify the dependent (target) variable.
1.2 Identify the independent (predictor) variables.
1.3 Define success criteria, such as desired R² or acceptable RMSE.
1.4 Understand the business or practical context of the problem.

#### 2 : Data Collection
2.1 Collect data from reliable sources.
2.2 Ensure data quality in terms of consistency and completeness.
2.3 Explore options for data augmentation if the dataset is small.
2.4 Document the source and collection process.
2.5 Note any assumptions made about the data.

#### 3 : Data Pre-Processing

**3.1> Feature Splitting and De-construction**
3.1.1 Break complex features into simpler components, such as splitting a date into year, month, and day.

**3.2> Encoding Categorical Columns**
3.2.1 Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables without order.
3.2.2 Use label encoding or ordinal encoding for variables with inherent order.

**3.3> Handling Missing Values**
3.3.1 Remove columns with excessive missing data (e.g., >50%).
3.3.2 Handle numerical missing values with mean, median, or KNN imputation.
3.3.3 Replace missing categorical values with the most frequent category or introduce a new category.

#### 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**4.1> Handle Outliers**
4.1.1 Identify outliers using boxplots, z-scores, or the IQR method.
4.1.2 Examine the column’s distribution using histograms or Q-Q plots.
4.1.3 Apply outlier removal techniques like capping, transformation, or robust regression if necessary.

**4.2> Deal with Correlation**
4.2.1 Generate a correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features.
4.2.2 Drop redundant features or apply PCA if needed.

**4.3> Visualize Data**
4.3.1 Use scatter plots to study relationships between variables.
4.3.2 Plot histograms to understand distributions.
4.3.3 Generate heatmaps to identify correlations.
4.3.4 Use pair plots for multivariate analysis.

#### 5 : Feature Engineering

**5.1> Feature Scaling**
5.1.1 Normalize data for bounded distributions.
5.1.2 Standardize data for normally distributed variables.
5.1.3 Apply log transformations for skewed distributions if required.

**5.2> Resampling**
5.2.1 Address class imbalance through oversampling or undersampling techniques when necessary.

**5.3> Advanced Techniques**
5.3.1 Introduce polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
5.3.2 Create interaction terms between variables.
5.3.3 Evaluate feature importance using methods like VIF to detect multicollinearity.

#### 6 : Model Creation
6.1 Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6.2 Train a linear regression model on the training set.
6.3 Experiment with variations like Ridge or Lasso regression.
6.4 Validate linear regression assumptions:
6.4.1 Check linearity.
6.4.2 Check homoscedasticity.
6.4.3 Ensure independence of residuals.
6.4.4 Confirm normality of residuals.
6.5 Use diagnostic plots to evaluate assumptions.

#### 7 : Model Testing

**7.1> Evaluate Using Metrics**
7.1.1 Calculate R² to assess the proportion of variance explained.
7.1.2 Compute RMSE to measure error magnitude.
7.1.3 Calculate MAE for average absolute error.
7.1.4 Use adjusted R² for models with multiple predictors.

**7.2> Perform Cross-Validation**
7.2.1 Conduct k-fold cross-validation.
7.2.2 Perform leave-one-out cross-validation if required.
7.2.3 Check validation results to detect overfitting or underfitting.

#### 8 : Model Optimization

**8.1> Hyperparameter Tuning**
8.1.1 Optimize hyperparameters using grid search.
8.1.2 Explore random search for quicker tuning.
8.1.3 Adjust regularization parameters for Ridge or Lasso regression.

**8.2> Validate Optimized Model Performance**
8.2.1 Re-evaluate the optimized model on the test set.
8.2.2 Perform sensitivity analysis to assess model stability.

#### 9 : Interpretation and Reporting
9.1 Analyze feature coefficients to understand their impact on the target variable.
9.2 Use tools like SHAP or LIME for interpreting predictions.
9.3 Summarize findings, limitations, and recommendations.
9.4 Create visual presentations or dashboards for stakeholders.

#### 10 : Deployment and Monitoring
(Optional for Advanced Users)
10.1 Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
10.2 Set up monitoring systems to track model performance.
10.3 Schedule retraining based on performance degradation.
